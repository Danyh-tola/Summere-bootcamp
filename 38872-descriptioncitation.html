								<div><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> <p>PPCS 2022</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) provides detailed information on the nature and characteristics of face-to-face contacts between police and the public, including the reason for and outcome of the contact and the respondent's satisfaction with the contact. The data can be used to estimate the likelihood of different types of contact for residents with different demographic characteristics, including contacts involving the use of nonfatal force by police. The PPCS is used to collect data from a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents age 16 or older as a supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey. To date, the PPCS has been conducted ten times by BJS:</p>

								<div><strong>Time Period(s):</strong> <p>2022</p></div>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual survey that collects data on crime against persons age 12 or older from a nationally representative, stratified, multistage cluster sample of U.S. households. The Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) is a supplement to the NCVS, administered to NCVS respondents age 16 or older.</p>
<p>BJS conducted a pilot test of the Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) in 1996 as a supplement to the NCVS. A revised version of the PPCS was fielded in 1999 among a national sample nearly 15 times as large as the 1996 pilot sample. Since 1999, the PPCS typically has been administered every 3 years as a supplemental survey to all persons age 16 or older within households sampled for the NCVS. However, recent PPCS supplements have been administered on an irregular basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau fielded the 2022 PPCS questionnaire, processed the survey data, and provided estimation specifications. The 2022 PPCS was conducted between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2022. Respondents were asked about their contacts with police during the past 12 months. For instance, persons interviewed in January 2022 were asked about contacts that occurred between February 2021 and January 2022. Respondents were provided a list of specific reasons for having contact with police. Persons who had more than one contact were asked more detailed questions about only their most recent contact during the time period.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau calculates PPCS response rates as the weighted ratio of persons completing interviews over persons who were eligible to receive the questionnaire. The unweighted PPCS response rate was 75.7% (95,300 respondents of the 125,900 eligible)(see Table 1 in the Source and Accuracy Statement for the 2022 Police-Public Contact Survey). In 2022, persons who completed their NCVS interview in a language other than English could complete the PPCS in the same language.</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p>Stratified multistage cluster sample.</p>
<p>The Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) interviews a nationally representative sample of households about their contacts with police during the previous 12 months. The PPCS is conducted as a supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey.</p></span></p>
								<div><strong>Time Method:</strong> <p>Cross-sectional</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) respondents age 16 or older interviewed during the first six months of 2022. The universe of the NCVS is all persons in the United States age 12 and older.</span></p>
								<div><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> <p>individual</p></div>
								<div><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> <p>survey data</p></div>
								<div><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> <p>computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), telephone interview</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> The combined PPCS response rate is a product of the NCVS household response rate, NCVS person response rate and the PPCS response rate. The overall weighted response rate for the 2022 PPCS was 50.3%.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> 2024-10-03</span></p>
								<div><strong>Version History:</strong> <p><p>2024-10-03 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Performed consistency checks.</li><li>Standardized missing values.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></p></div>
		        		<h2>Analysis Information:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Weight:</strong> <p>To obtain national estimates, the weight variable must be used.</p>
<p>The overall weight is calculated by multiplying the PPCS base weight by the PPCS noninterview adjustment factor. This adjustment factor weights up to the total PPCS sample for persons interviewed for NCVS but not PPCS.</p></span></p>
